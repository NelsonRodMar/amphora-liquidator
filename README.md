# Amphora Liquidator Bot


This is liquidation bot for [Amphora Finance](https://amphorafinance.com/) build to be used with [OpenZeppelin Autotask](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/defender/v1/autotasks).


## üè∫ What is Amphora Finance ? 
Amphora Finance  is a CDP borrow/lend protocol.

Users deposit sUSD(v3) to lend, and in turn recieve USDA a rebasing token that automatically rebases collecting yield.

To borrow from the sUSD pool, users open a "vault" and deposit collateral. Each vault is unique to a user keeping isolated positions and it can recieve both ERC-20 tokens and Curve LP tokens.

Curve LP tokens are deposited into their relative pools on Convex, so that users continue to earn CRV and CVX rewards while using the assets as collateral.

The protocol takes a small fee of the CRV and CVX rewards and in exchange rewars the user with $AMPH the protocols governance token.
